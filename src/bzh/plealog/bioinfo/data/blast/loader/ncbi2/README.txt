XSD file from:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/data_specs/schema/

File retrieved on Oct 2019: NCBI_BlastOutput2.mod.xsd
Renamed to: NCBI_BlastOutput2.xsd

Then JAXB class generation using:
cd <core-api-home>
xjc -d src -p bzh.plealog.bioinfo.data.blast.loader.ncbi2 src/bzh/plealog/bioinfo/data/blast/loader/ncbi2/NCBI_BlastOutput2.xsd

Added notice after testing XML2:
XSD is invalid with respect to BLAST result files generated by NCBI BLAST: elements described
in XSD (and so forth in Java classes) do not match XML elements reported in XML data file.

So generated classes where edited accordingly ; I did not edit XSD, since class generation 
afterward produced strange results; and I'm not so fluent with XSD, class generation, JaxB...
