<p>This package contains the components used to model a Rich Search Result.</p> 

<p>The basic components used to model a Search Result closely follows the way NCBI and 
EBI have represented a Blast Search Result. </p>

<p>Such a result contains some iterations, that contains some hit,s that contains some 
HSPs. These elements of the data model are represented using the following components: 
SROutput, SRIteration, SRHit and SRHsp. </p>

<p>To enable rich Search Result representation, the SROutput model is capable of handling
Sequence Information and Features. The former are associated to SRHit components whereas
the latter are associated to SRHsp components.</p>

<p>Each search result is usually associated with some parameters and request information. 
These are represented in the data model with SRParameters and SRRequestInfo, respectively.
To enable an extensible model, these interface represent the set of available parameters
using tables of key and value pairs. </p>

<p>Each iteration is usually associated with some statistical values that are produced by
the search system (e.g. Blast). This is represented using a SRStatistics component.</p>
